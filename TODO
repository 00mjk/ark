TODO
-----

Feature-wise:
- Rename option
- Archive conversion with save as 
- Thorough bug hunting

Code-wise:
- Kill the mess of signals in arkwidget.cc
- Get rid of QStrings. Carry KURLs through 99% of the process, and
only convert when necessary.
- More intuitive 'chained' archive support (ie. .tar.bz2)

- file_quit()'s used for extractOnly are a mess. Clean me up.

For KDE 3.0:
- rewrite :-)
- need to add support for split files
- need to add some kind of progress feedback to the user
- don't exit when something is wrong
