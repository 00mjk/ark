TODO

More than I can count. After working with the code for awhile, I have come
to see that so many developers with such different styles has lead to
hacks on top of hacks, and the code is DESPERATELY in need of serious
re-engineering.

Most important is arkwidget.cc which is downright PAINFUL to work with.
The migration to arkwidgetbase took a bit of the bloat out, but the signals
are still spread out and awkward to trace about.


Feature-wise:
- Rename option
- Archive conversion with save as 
- Thorough bug hunting
- Read-write part for full konqueror integration

Code-wise:
- Kill the mess of signals in arkwidget.cc - the triple-overload on
file_open is nonsense.
- Get rid of QStrings. Carry KURLs through 99% of the process, and
only convert when necessary.
- More intuitive 'chained' archive support (ie. .tar.bz2)
