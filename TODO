TODO
-----

-> Get rid of ArkWidget, it does not make sense. Some parts of it (most of the actions) should
   go to Archive, other parts should go to ArkPart.

-> Split Arch into Archive (generic class for archives) and another class with a name yet to be decided for
   handling support for command-line archives.

-> Improve error reporting.

-> Clean up the Configuration Dialog. Most settings there do not make sense, and should either be trashed or
   moved to somewhere where they make sense (some of them might go to the extraction dialog).
