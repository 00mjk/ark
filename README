--------------------------

From the OLD README:

Type 'configure', then 'make', and 'make install'. Use the online help
if anything is unclear to you.


There may be a few bugs, as well as missing features, but the program should
be fairly usable.

Changes:
	o Internationalization
	o Edit...Extract and View really do work from the archive directory
	o kfsstnd compliance
	o Now uses ktablistbox
	o no memory leaks!!! perhaps...
        o Renamed from kzip to ark by David Faure <faure@kde.org>

Thanks to:
	o All the KDE developers
	o Sebestyen Zoltan

any suggestions, etc send to <duranceau@kde.org> or <palm9744@kettering.edu>
