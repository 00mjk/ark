        * fixed up icons, continued with merge: enabling toolbar buttons
 	  and menu items. Close enables don't work yet...
        * Fixed status bar totals for selection, number and size.

	* started merge with Corel Linux code.
 	* added toolbar icons (with two more on the way), lock files,
 	  and fixed the sorting for numeric column data.
        * added preliminary code to count number of files and total sizes
          in the status bar, but it does nothing so far.
        * created a new problem: action_add in zip now segfaults.
