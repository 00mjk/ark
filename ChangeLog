	* KUniqueApplication stuff was enabled by waba, with KCmdLineArgs
	  code. Modified it to work according to Cooperating-SDI model.
	* Moved windowList to ArkApplication (accessed through a global
 	pointer).

2000-01-10: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Finished renaming ArkData to ArkSettings.
	* Tried using KDialogBase for Add dialog - not working too well.

2000-01-6: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Disabled KUniqueApplication stuff for now... was interfering with
	  development with crashes. Will add later.
	* Asks "Are you sure?" when you try to "New" over an existing zip
	* Began work on new extract dialog - old one doesn't work any longer 
	  due to kdelibs changes. Doesn't do anything yet - just trying out
	  for look&feel with error-checking.
	  Idea of extract: highlight the ones to be extracted and then
	  let the right archiver grab all the highlighted files (or current).

	* created ArkApplication : public KUniqueApplication
        * Code now to follow the Co-operating SDI model.
	* Some problems with dcop still... exiting the last window doesn't
	  get you back the prompt!

        * fixed up icons, continued with merge: enabling toolbar buttons
 	  and menu items. Close enables don't work yet...
        * Fixed status bar totals for selection, number and size.

1999-12-09  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* started merge with Corel Linux code.
 	* added toolbar icons (with two more on the way), lock files,
 	  and fixed the sorting for numeric column data.
        * added preliminary code to count number of files and total sizes
          in the status bar, but it does nothing so far.
        * created a new problem: action_add in zip now segfaults.

1999-07-05  Francois-Xavier Duranceau  <duranceau@kde.org>
	* added selection with regular expressions
