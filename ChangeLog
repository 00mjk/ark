	* Got rid of KProcess data member in Arch - no need for it with the
	  new way that KProcess does its work: we are always passing it 
	  around to the functions that need it. This way we won't get
 	  confused when there are more than one processes happening.
	* Made tar more asynchronous, redid the temp file creation & updating.

2000-03-03:  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Made zip fully asynchronous.
	
2000-03-02:  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
        * add and delete now work for tar files, although I'll probably
	  change how temp files are created from compressed tars and
	  how they are used to update the original archive...
 	  Note: ark uses KTar for display and shell process for everything
	  else.
	* Reduced the number of calls of slotSelectionChanged
	* OK, _now_ I'm done with the enable/disable stuff - I swear!
	* Other miscellaneous abstractions with zip->arch code
	
2000-02-24: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Got showFile interface working (see zip)
	* Started using KTar in tar. Seems to display OK.
	  No other functionality yet for tar.
	
2000-02-22: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* More work on the abstract base class for archives - moved lots of
	  slots dealing with the KProcess from zip.cpp to arch.cpp
	* Some work on tar. Doesn't work yet.

2000-02-16: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* More consistent disabling/enabling of menu items and toolbar buttons.
	* Added "add directory" - might need some more tweaking in zip so it
	  doesn't flatten the files out.	
	
2000-02-15: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Added drop support. Doesn't seem to work with directories though.
	* Toolbar icons stopped working briefly - renamed them to ensure no
 	  ambiguity.

2000-02-14: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Separated GUI and backend in zip, which will be the model
	  for the other formats once it's just-right. Next I'll make sure
	  drag and drop works.
	
2000-02-09: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Finally have Add and Extract working for zip

2000-02-07:  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* new locking scheme to prevent users from opening the same archive
	  in two different windows. Handles symlinks. But I can't figure out
	  why raise() alone doesn't do it  - I hide and show the window 
	  instead - blech!
	* made classes more const correct
	* add dialog still doesn't work. Problem with KFileView?

2000-01-18: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* KUniqueApplication stuff was enabled by waba, with KCmdLineArgs
	  code. Modified it to work according to Cooperating-SDI model.
	* Moved windowList to ArkApplication (accessed through a static
	  function). ArkApplication is now modelled on the singleton pattern.
  
2000-01-10: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Finished renaming ArkData to ArkSettings.
	* Tried using KDialogBase for Add dialog - not working too well.

2000-01-6: Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* Disabled KUniqueApplication stuff for now... was interfering with
	  development with crashes. Will add later.
	* Asks "Are you sure?" when you try to "New" over an existing zip
	* Began work on new extract dialog - old one doesn't work any longer 
	  due to kdelibs changes. Doesn't do anything yet - just trying out
	  for look&feel with error-checking.
	  Idea of extract: highlight the ones to be extracted and then
	  let the right archiver grab all the highlighted files (or current).

	
1999-12-16  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* created ArkApplication : public KUniqueApplication
        * Code now to follow the Co-operating SDI model.
	* Some problems with dcop still... exiting the last window doesn't
	  get you back the prompt!
	
1999-12-13  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
        * fixed up icons, continued with merge: enabling toolbar buttons
 	  and menu items. Close enables don't work yet...
        * Fixed status bar totals for selection, number and size.

1999-12-09  Emily Ezust <emilye@corel.com>
	* started merge with Corel Linux code.
 	* added toolbar icons (with two more on the way), lock files,
 	  and fixed the sorting for numeric column data.
        * added preliminary code to count number of files and total sizes
          in the status bar, but it does nothing so far.
        * created a new problem: action_add in zip now segfaults.

1999-07-05  Francois-Xavier Duranceau  <duranceau@kde.org>
	* added selection with regular expressions

1999-04-11  Francois-Xavier Duranceau  <duranceau@kde.org>

	* created this file
