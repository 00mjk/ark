== Coding Style ==
Ark follows the kdelibs/Qt coding style. For more information about them,
please see:

== Sending patches ==
To send patches for Ark, you can choose one of the following:

1. Use KDE's Phabricator at <https://phabricator.kde.org>.
   The diff should be created against the Ark repository.
2. Use KDE's ReviewBoard tool in <https://git.reviewboard.kde.org>.
   The review should be sent for the Ark product, and the `kdeutils' group should be
   added to the review request.
3. Use git's send-email command and send
   it to the kde-utils-devel@kde.org mailing list.

If you already have a KDE commit account, it is still preferrable to contact
the maintainer instead of committing directly, at least to be a good citizen
and especially so that git mistakes are not made (see the `Using git' section).

== Using git ==
The development model adopted by Ark is simple and rely on git's easy merging
and branching capabilities.  If in doubt, do not hesitate to ask!

First of all, you should do your work in a separate branch, and each commit
should be as atomic as possible.  This way, if you are asked to make changes to
them, the rest of your work is not disturbed and you can easily rebase.

New features are committed to the `master' branch, respecting KDE's Release
Schedule policies.  This means the soft and hard freeze periods must be
respected, as well as the string freeze policy.

Bug fixes are committed to the latest stable branch (for example, KDE/4.8),
which is then merged into the `master' branch.  Do *NOT* cherry-pick commits
into multiple branches! It makes following history unnecessarily harder for no
reason.

To merge the stable branch into `master', the following steps can be followed:

   $ git checkout KDE/4.8 # Whatever the stable branch is
   $ # hack, hack, hack
   $ # commit
   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge --log --edit -s recursive -Xours KDE/4.8

Do not worry if unrelated commits (such as translation ones made by KDE's
translation infrastructure) are also merged: translation commits are
automatically reverted when needed, and other commits being merged should be
bug fixes by definition.

When committing your changes, do *NOT* create unnecessary merge commits with
`git pull', as these commits are completely avoidable and make following
history harder.  If you are committing your changes, *rebase* first.
